*** - ajh17/VimCompletesMe
- sheerun/vim-polyglot
- terryma/vim-multiple-cursors
- tpope/vim-eunuch
- Valloric/YouCompleteMe (pros: intelligent and convenient autocompletion, better than that of supertab; cons: makes vim (and everything else) SLOW; the fantastic autocompletion does not outweigh the slow startup times; i'm gonna use this exclusively with gvim, it makes sense just because i would use normal vim for something very quick, and youcompleteme would slow it down; in this case, i would use supertab. but gvim on the otherhand, since it's bigger and more heavy duty, would probably benefit from some heavy duty completion plugin like youcompleteme)
