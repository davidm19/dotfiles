NEED TO FIND A WAY TO SET UP FZF FOR REGULAR VIM, NOT SERVER!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-21-2019 5:26PM:
FIGURED OUT HOW TO SET UP FZF FOR REGULAR VIM A HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE PREVIOUS ENTRY.
JUST NEEDED TO MANUALLY INSTALL FZF (GIT CLONE => INSTALL.PY) AND DOWNLOAD THE FZF.VIM PLUGIN.

ALSO SOMETHING INTERESTING... https://github.com/tom5760/arch-install WHY DON'T I MOD SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR MY OWN USE?

THIS GUY'S VIMRC IS JUST SETTINGS FOR DIFFERENT FILES... MAYBE ADAPT THIS ALONG WITH WOLFGANG'S? https://github.com/notthebee/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/.vimrc

ALSO THIS: https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/18231/what-is-the-difference-of-using-au-bufnewfile-bufread-py-and-au-filetype-py (DON'T USE au BufNewFile,BufRead USE au Filetype <language/format> set) (ALSO THE COMMIT MESSAGE FILETYPE NAME IS gitcommit, IF YOU WANNA KNOW THE FILETYPE FOR A CERTAIN FILE JUST OPEN THAT FILE AND TYPE IN THE COMMAND :set filetype?)

AND THIS: https://github.com/AGitBoy/Config/blob/master/vim/.vimrc

FOR MARKDOWN: COMBINE GOYO (LOOK AT SETTINGS IN PAST VIMRCS) AND LIMELIGHT (YOU CAN STACK COMMANDS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER IN au Filetype LIKE IN THE THIRD EXAMPLE IN THIS THREAD: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/158968/changing-vim-indentation-behavior-by-file-type BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY CAUTIOUS, USE AUTOGROUPS/FTPLUGIN FILES: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27331467/run-toggle-command-for-certain-filetypes-only ==> https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide/blob/2fe0507039c8eb02b89320e76968385d299d8cd6/vimrc.vim (SEARCH FOR augroup AND/OR LOOK AT THE augroup FOR delimitMate)

GOYO SETTING: Goyo 75x75-40% and let g:goyo_linenr = 1

ALSO NOW I KNOW WHAT GPG IS, AND PGP IS INTEGRATED INTO IT SOMEHOW. WILL PROBABLY NEED TO SET UP GPG IN THE FUTURE

ALSO I HAVE NOW EMBRACED THE POSSIBILITY (MAKE NOTE OF POSSIBILITY) OF MALE PATTERN BALDNESS... IT'S JUST RELIANT ON LARRY DAVID, KELLY SLATER, ZINEDINE ZIDANE, AND GQ MAGAZINE. BUT, IF IT EVER HAPPENS (GOD FORBID), I HAVE A WAY TO BEAT MY INSECURITIES, AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
