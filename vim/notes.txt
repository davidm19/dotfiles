NEED TO FIND A WAY TO SET UP FZF FOR REGULAR VIM, NOT SERVER!

FIGURED OUT HOW TO SET UP FZF FOR REGULAR VIM A HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE PREVIOUS ENTRY.
JUST NEEDED TO MANUALLY INSTALL FZF (GIT CLONE => INSTALL.PY) AND DOWNLOAD THE FZF.VIM PLUGIN.

ALSO SOMETHING INTERESTING... https://github.com/tom5760/arch-install WHY DON'T I MOD SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR MY OWN USE?

ALSO NOW I KNOW WHAT GPG IS, AND PGP IS INTEGRATED INTO IT SOMEHOW. WILL PROBABLY NEED TO SET UP GPG IN THE FUTURE

ALSO I HAVE NOW EMBRACED THE POSSIBILITY (MAKE NOTE OF POSSIBILITY) OF MALE PATTERN BALDNESS... IT'S JUST RELIANT ON LARRY DAVID, KELLY SLATER, ZINEDINE ZIDANE, AND GQ MAGAZINE. BUT, IF IT EVER HAPPENS (GOD FORBID), I HAVE A WAY TO BEAT MY INSECURITIES, AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
