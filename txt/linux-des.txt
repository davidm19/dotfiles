remember wpa_supplicant for arch on wifi!!

=====================
======== DEs ========
=====================
1. ---- KDE ----
Put bar on top, set size to 30, delete useless widgets (clipboard and such) and change KDE app launcher logo to arch (configure panel --> configure app --> change logo) (and add Icons Only Task Manager) (remember redshift control widget!)
Theme: Aritim-Dark-KDE (Breeze dark if things get wonky, but just adjust the plasma theme to fedora 30 so SierraBreeze will work)
Window Decorations: SierraBreeze
Icons: Papirus
Disable Tab bar (settings --> configure Konsole)
You can (and should) still use ulauncher!
Change desktop, screensaver and login manager wallpapers
change all fonts (yes, even terminals. do size 11 for terminals, 10 everywhere else) to inconsolata
BLUR KONSOLE! (change background color to #000000 and blur to anywhere from 18% to 36%) (and add a keyboard shortcut for opening it: go to settings --> global keyboard shortcuts and set it for konsole)
How to add media key functionality: https://nallerooth.com/post/how_to_configure_spotify_hotkeys_in_kde/
How to increase font size in console: Ctrl+Shift+Plus
SDDM THEMES: https://store.kde.org/browse/cat/101/ord/rating/
MORE COMPLICATED SDDM THEME: https://github.com/3ximus/aerial-sddm-theme
LIGHTDM THEME: https://github.com/linuxmint/slick-greeter

2. ---- GNOME ----
OPTIONAL FOR UBUNTU: sudo apt remove gnome-shell-extension-ubuntu-dock
Install ulauncher and have it start at startup

papirus icons + osx-arc-dark theme

Switch between workspaces:
1. ctrl + alt + up/down
2. Super (windows/macos command) + page up/down

3. ---- MATE ----
Change themes, icons, etc in (rclick--> change desktop background --> theme --> customize)
Change fonts to Inconsolata Medium 11 (except for Window title, which is Inconsolata 12)
Change terminal color to all black
Disable sounds (sound --> Enable window and button sounds)
Set preferred applications: Chromium (web browsers), xfce4-terminal (terminal)
Use dconf-editor to remove desktop icons (dconf --> org --> mate --> caja)
Startup applications also exist
Changing workspaces is the same as in gnome


4. ---- XFCE4 ----
Theme: X-Arc-Shadow (Arc-Dark is fine too)
Icons: Papirus-Dark (for Debian use Paper)
Fonts: Inconsolata 11 (general settings (set title bar font in window manager tweaks, and set window theme to arc shadow as well))
Remove desktop icons and panel

2. ---- DWM ----
DWM GOALS!
- https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/7euy6f/dwmvoid_my_lightweight_netbook/ (use curie font though! and maybe try this first and use navy blue/slate instead of green)

- https://www.reddit.com/r/UsabilityPorn/comments/bkn0jt/i3_towards_simplicity/ (not dwm but still pretty with bitmap fonts and everything)

DWM APPS:
- dwm + st
- xorg-xinit
- feh
- redshift
- sflock

DWM TODOS:
- give nnn a try (just gotta learn the keybindings and add them to the VimNotes repo) (add a keyboard shortcut to start it from the command line, just like you did for sflock)

BSPWM NOTES:
- bspwm can support multimonitor setups. here's the bspwm entry on arch linux for multimonitor setups https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bspwm#Note_for_multi-monitor_setups and here's a reddit thread helping someone do this. https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1xx7d9/some_help_with_configuring_bspwm_multiple/

BSPWM TODO:
- rofi network manager wut??

OPENBOX GOALS:
- I haven't found any I like!

OPENBOX APPS:
- openbox + obconf + openbox-themes (AUR)
- xinit
- rofi
- st
- xfce4-terminal
- tint2
- and literally everything in the menus you haven't installed

OPENBOX TIPS:
- Change fonts in rc.xml (first: cp -R /etc/xdg/openbox ~/.config/ so you can access it in ~/.config/openbox folder)
- tint2, like polybar, has its own folder in .config (and the config file is called tint2rc)
